# Seniority-Classification-Model


The aim of this project is to build a Binary Seniority Classification Model ( Junior, Senior ) to label jobs and then help people to apply to their desired seniority level. 

Since the initial labelon the dataframe was messed up, we build new labels based on years of experience and keywords in the job title. Then we used job descriptions embedded as features to predict the seniority labels.
